# Build a Portfolio Website - Project 1 - Front End Web Development
This Project is part of Udacity's Front End Web Development "NanoDegree" course. 

## Instructions
I was provided a design mockup as a PDF-file and had to replicate that design in HTML and CSS.  The result would be my portfolio website displaying the skills learned in this module.

## Skills Used
In order to get this project completed, I had to learn and implement the following skills:
- Semantic HTML
- CSS Styling
- Utilizing a grid based layout.  I learned and used FLexBox to build my grid
- Use a viewport Meta tag
- Learn and use file structure "CSS for style sheets and IMG for images"
- Following HTML formatting/styling rules

## Result
After learning and implementing these skills, the result was this one page website I coded.
